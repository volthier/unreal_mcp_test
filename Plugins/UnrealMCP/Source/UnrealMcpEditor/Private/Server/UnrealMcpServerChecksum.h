/**
 * Pure (no engine-process / no live-network) download-integrity logic for the shared
 * `gamedev-mcp-server` binary: the `SHA256SUMS` manifest URL builder, the coreutils-format parser,
 * the exact-key RID digest lookup, the case-insensitive digest compare, and the single fail-closed
 * `VerifyZipChecksum` verdict. `FUnrealMcpServerManager::DownloadBinaryIfNeeded` calls this BETWEEN the
 * zip download and `FZipArchiveReader` / `FPlatformProcess::CreateProc` — so a downloaded server zip is
 * NEVER extracted or launched unless its SHA256 matches the release's published `SHA256SUMS` manifest
 * (issue #155). A compromised release asset or a trusted-CA MITM would otherwise yield arbitrary code
 * execution on the developer's machine.
 *
 * Keeping this logic here — rather than inline in `FUnrealMcpServerManager` (whose methods touch HTTP,
 * the filesystem, and process spawn) — makes every decision unit-testable in an Automation spec with no
 * live download and no running server: each function below is a deterministic string/enum/map transform.
 * The HTTP fetch + SHA256 compute (via a self-contained FIPS 180-4 SHA-256 — `ComputeSha256Hex` below;
 * UE's `FPlatformMisc::GetSHA256Signature` is a desktop stub that asserts) that surround this verdict live
 * in the editor-coupled manager. Mirrors Unity-MCP's `McpServerChecksum` (PR #842) and Godot-MCP's
 * `GodotMcpServerView` checksum seam (PR #193); same parser/verify/test shape, adapted to UE types.
