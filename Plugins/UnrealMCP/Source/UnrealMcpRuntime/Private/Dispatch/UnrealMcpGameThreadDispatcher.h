/**
 * The Unreal-MCP game-thread dispatcher (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §4) — the analog of Unity's
 * MainThread.Instance.Run() / Godot's GodotMainThread. Tool bodies touch the Unreal API, which is
 * only safe on the game thread, so the IPC reader thread NEVER runs a tool body directly: it calls
 * Dispatch(), which posts the body to the game thread via AsyncTask and returns a TFuture the bridge
 * attaches a continuation to. Slow tools therefore never stall the IPC heartbeat.
 *
 * A per-call timeout completes the future with a structured error if the body has not finished; the
 * body's late result is then dropped (the promise's single-completion guard prevents a double-set, §4).
