/**
 * The runtime (in-game) bootstrap for Unreal-MCP (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §12.4) — the UE analog of Unity's
 * `UnityMcpPluginRuntime.Initialize().Build().Connect()`. A UGameInstanceSubsystem, so it is auto-instantiated
 * once per UGameInstance (PIE, Standalone, packaged Development/Shipping) — but it NEVER auto-connects.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *  - Initialize(): builds the registry + runtime-safe tool families + game-thread dispatcher + IPC bridge
 *    server, generates the one-shot token, and ARMS the loopback listener (BridgeServer->Start). It does
 *    NOT spawn the sidecar and does NOT connect. It also installs the §12.6 RUNTIME world resolver
 *    (`GetGameInstance()->GetWorld()`) into FUnrealMcpWorldProvider so runtime tool bodies resolve the live
 *    game world.
 *  - Connect(): the single explicit opt-in entry point. Spawns the sidecar (SidecarManager->StartForPort)
 *    and pushes the §1.3 `config` IPC message with keepConnected:true and the resolved host/token/mode.
 *  - Disconnect(): tears the sidecar down (orphan-safe).
 *  - Deinitialize(): graceful teardown — stops the sidecar, tears down the bridge, clears the world resolver.
 *
 * SECURITY (§12.8 — RCE-class surface if reachable; all mitigations enforced in Connect):
 *  1. Explicit opt-in only — auto-instantiated, never auto-connecting. NO RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod
 *     auto-dial, NO config-asset auto-connect. (Review-gated invariant.)
 *  2. Loopback IPC + one-shot stdin token (inherited from FUnrealMcpBridgeServer / FUnrealMcpSidecarManager).
 *  3. Build-config gating: bUnrealMcpAllowShipping Build.cs flag → UNREAL_MCP_ALLOW_SHIPPING. With 0, Connect
 *     in a Shipping build logs + returns false.
 *  4. Kill switch: UUnrealMcpRuntimeSettings::bRuntimeMcpEnabled default FALSE → Connect short-circuits.
 *  5. Loopback-host default: Connect rejects non-loopback hosts unless bAllowRemoteHost is passed.
 *
 * QA convenience without a recompile: the console commands `UnrealMcp.Connect <host> [token]` and
 * `UnrealMcp.Disconnect` (registered in Initialize, de-registered in Deinitialize) drive Connect/Disconnect
 * on the active game instance's subsystem.
